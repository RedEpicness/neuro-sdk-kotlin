## Kotlin Neuro SDK

A Kotlin implementation of the [Neuro SDK](https://github.com/VedalAI/neuro-sdk).

While the project has been reasonably tested, I have not implemented it fully into a game yet,
so there might still be minor changes done to the project as I'm using it for a game integration.

### Getting Started

WIP, will add once GitHub CI is added and tested...

### Support

Feel free to open an issue or a discussion if you have any questions or problems with this SDK.

### License

This project is licensed under the MIT License. See the LICENSE file for more information.
